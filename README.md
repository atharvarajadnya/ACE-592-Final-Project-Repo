# ACE 592 Final Project: The Environmental Kuznets Curve

This project explores the Environmental Kuznets Curve at the country level. After a brief visualization of country level CO2 (per capita) emissions from 1900-2021, we explore a subset of 20 countries that fall at different points along the Kuznets curve. We also look at total damages by these countries, measured as the integral of CO2 emissions over time. We then perform a case study of the United States, a country on the downward side of the Kuznets Curve. We hypothesize events in the period that may have affected or been interesting when considering the position of the Kuznets curve, and we also look at energy consumption over the period. Finally, we look at sentiment of SOTU Addresses over the period and see if we can learn anything about the state of American politics that may or may not have something to do with the country's position on the curve.

#### The jupyter notebooks are in order by name. Each one is annotated with explanations of what is presented.

#### The Figures folder contains every figure from the jupyter notebooks. They are named in order.

#### The Kuznets_Report document is a writeup of the findings of this project. The Final Presentation is simply a powerpoint designed to be presented.



## Our code sources are listed below. Each of these links contains a list and description of all columns. These are each stored in the Datasets Folder, except the SOTU data is in a zip file.

#### We also read in data from the World Happiness Report and the Global Leader Ideology Report, though we did not use either for analysis.
